Planet Dataset Analysis

Project Overview

This project is related to the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of dataset planets in Python.

The objective of the project to clean up and handle missing values in the dataset and to perform some exploratory data analysis on planetary data for pattern identification.

Dataset:
data is from between October 2023.
It is used to validate data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy (stats)

Project Workflow:
Importing required Python libraries
Loading the dataset
Data cleaning:
*Handling missing values
*Removing duplicates
*Data formatting

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
*Statistical summaries
*Data visualization

Analyzing the dataset to assess trends and directions

Visualizations:

Different visualizations were done using Matplotlib and Seaborn library to understand better the relationships among different planetary features.
